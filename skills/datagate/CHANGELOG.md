[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- **The Claude Desktop bundle now carries the companion CLI.** Every MCP tool runs the
  CLI under the hood, but the `.mcpb` used to contain only the MCP server, so a one-click
  install on a machine without the CLI failed at the first tool call. The bundle now ships
  both binaries side by side for macOS (universal), Windows x64 and Linux x64. Older
  bundles are unchanged; this release's bundle is the first for this connector to include it.
- **The MCP server reports its real version.** `serverInfo.version` used to read
  `0.0.0-dev` (or a hard-coded literal) in every released MCP binary because the release
  build stamped the version into the CLI only. The release now stamps both and checks the
  built server's `initialize` reply against the tag before publishing.
- **Installers verify what they download.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now require a
  sealed (immutable) release, verify both binaries against the release's SHA-256 sidecars
  before touching anything, and replace the old binaries in a single transaction that is
  undone if any step fails. (Served from the repository, so this applies to every install
  from now on, not only this version.)
- No connector code changed in this release; it exists so the published bundle and
  binaries pick up the release-pipeline fixes above.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Initial DataGate connector: read-only (list/get/search) coverage of customers,
  customer users, agreements, service items, assignments, rate cards, sites,
  product templates, kit templates, invoices, products, delivery methods, product
  transactions, and account managers, plus a local SQLite mirror with offline
  search.
